236,Barbell Jammers,Barbell,Abs,"Starting Position: Place the end of a standard barbell in a corner so that it will not move unnecessarily, place a weight on one end of the barbell with a collar so that the weight can not fall off during the exercise.? Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width,?your toes pointed forward or slightly outward?facing the end of the barbell so that it is between both feet and directly under your center of gravity.Squat down by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees, as you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Brace your core to keep your trunk stable and spine straight. Continue to lower yourself until your thighs are near, or parallel with the floor, or until your heels begin to lift off the floor, or until your torso begins to round or flex forward.  Lift the end of the barbell and firmly grasp it in both hands using a closed grip (thumbs wrapped around the bar). Position the end of the bar directly in front of your chest directly under your chin. Maintain your body position with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Keep your chest held up and out, head in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised), heels on the floor, and shoulders over or slightly in front of the bar. Your eyes should be facing forward or slightly upward. Upward phase:  Push your feet into the ground and drive your hips forward to extend your legs and begin the upward phase of the movement by standing up while continuing to hold the end of the barbell in front of your chest.  Monitor your feet, ankles and knees; to maintain control of your feet and knees push the floor away from you while keeping your knees aligned over the second toe of each foot as you move up to a standing position. As you approach a full standing position quickly push through your heels, extending and pushing the hips towards an upright position, begin to press the end of the barbell upwards with both hands continuing to grip the end of the bar, stiffen your core and abdominal muscles (¡°bracing¡±) to stabilize your spine. As the hips and knees reach full extension, continue pushing upward onto your toes at the ankle while pressing the bar overhead into full extension. The movement for the bar should start at the hips, travel through the trunk and continue through the shoulders and arms. Avoid arching your back during the overhead push. Roll up on your toes as you move your legs into triple extension (ankle plantarflexion, knee and hip extension). Exercise Variation: Increase the velocity or speed of the movement to transition from a strength to a power-based exercise. Start with light resistance then gradually progress this exercise by increasing the weight and increasing the pace of the exercise so that you begin to perform the movement explosively against heavier resistance. Technique is very important in this lift. Do not progress to explosive movements until you master your technique.",,,,,,,,,,
117,BOSU Squat Jumps,BOSU Trainer,Abs,"Starting Position: Place a BOSU??balance trainer on the floor 3-6"" in front of your feet on a non-slip surface. Stand with your feet hip-width apart or closer, arms by your sides, depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal / core muscles) to stiffen your spine. Downward Phase: Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then slowly moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. Continue to lower yourself until you feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Try to maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips, keep your head facing the BOSU directly and position to your arms where comfortable or where they offer the greatest degree of balance support. Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode upwards through your lower extremity onto the top of the BOSU, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As your jump into the air, keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor, but bring them together to land on the top of the BOSU. Landing: The most important components of the landing phase on a BOSU are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees. Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels to create a level foot, parallel with the floor. Always push your hips backwards and drop your hips to absorb the jumping forces. Avoid locking out your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries. Land with your trunk inclined slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine. Exercise Variation: As you develop your jumping and landing skills, you can progress the exercise intensity and complexity by: (1) driving your arms behind you during the downward phase (illustrated), (2) driving your arms forward (illustrated) or upward (towards an overhead position) during the jumping phase, or (3) driving your knees towards your chest during the jumping phase. It is suggested, you first learn how to squat and perform regular squat jumps before attempting to jump onto the BOSU.",,,,,,,,,,
119,BOSU Lateral Jumps,BOSU Trainer,Abs,"Starting Position: Place a BOSU? balance trainer on the floor 3-6"" to your left on a non-slip surface. Stand with your feet hip-width apart or closer, arms by your sides, depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal / core muscles) to stiffen your spine. Downward Phase: Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then slowly moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. Continue to lower yourself until your feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Try to maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips, keep your head facing directly forward and position to your arms where comfortable or where they offer the greatest degree of balance support. Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode sideways (left) and upwards through your lower extremity onto the top of the BOSU, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As your jump into the air, try to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor, but bring them together to land on the top of the BOSU. Landing: The most important components of the landing phase on a BOSU are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees. Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels to create a level foot, parallel with the floor. Always push your hips backwards and drop your hips to absorb the jumping forces. Avoid locking out your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries. Land with your trunk inclined slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine. With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your landing phase, explode sideways (left) and upwards again through your lower extremity off the top of the BOSU towards the floor, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As you jump into the air, try to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor, moving them back to a hip-width stance (position) or slightly closer. Exercise Variation: As you develop your jumping and landing skills, you can progress the exercise intensity and complexity by: (1) driving your arms behind you during the downward phase, (2) driving your arms forward, upward (towards an overhead position) and slightly sideways in the jumping direction during the jumping phases, (3)driving your knees towards your chest during the jumping phases or (4) moving back and forth more rapidly or adding more BOSU balance trainers and performing a series of jumps in each direction. Before attempting to jump laterally onto the BOSU, learn first how to squat and perform regular squat jumps, BOSU squat jumps and lateral cone jumps.",,,,,,,,,,
135,Bodyweight Squat,None,Abs,"Starting Position: Begin standing with your feet?slightly wider than hip-width, with the toes turned slightly outwards with your hands by your sides so the palms facing inwards. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull the shoulders down and back). Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles (¡°bracing¡±) to stabilize your spine. Hold your chest up and out, tilt your head slightly up, shift your weight back into your heels while pushing your hips towards the wall behind you. Downward Phase: Start the downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your hips and knees simultaneously. As you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Maintain tension in the core muscles (continue bracing) and attempt to keep your back flat. Continue to lower yourself until your thighs are parallel or almost parallel with the floor, until your heels begin to lift off the floor, or until your torso begins to round or flex forward. Monitor your feet, ankles and knees, ensuring that the feet don't move, the ankles do not collapse in or out and the knees remain aligned over the second toe. From the Lowered Position: the knees should continue to remain aligned over the second toe and body weight should be evenly distributed between the balls and heels of the feet. From the side, the position of the tibia (shinbone) and torso should be parallel with each other and the low back should appear flat or showing the beginning of some rounding. Upward Phase: While maintaining your back, chest and head-up position, exhale and extend the hips and knees by pushing your feet into the floor through your heels. The hips and torso need to rise together while keeping the heels flat on the floor and knees aligned over the second toe. Continue extending until you reach your starting position. Think about inhaling on the way down and exhaling while exerting on the way back to the initial standing position.

14,Bird-dog,None,Abs,"Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor, positioning your knees and feet hip-width apart, with your feet dorsi-flexed (toes pointing towards your body). Slowly lean forward to place your hands on the mat, positioning them directly under your shoulders at shoulder-width with your fingers facing forward. Reposition your hands and knees as necessary so that your knees are directly under your hips and hands are directly under your shoulders. Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles to position your spine in a neutral position, avoid any excessive sagging or arching. Upward Phase: This exercise involves simultaneous movement of your leg and contralateral (opposite) arm. This exercise is best performed facing a mirror. Hip Extension: Slowly extend your left hip (raise and straighten the knee) attempting to extend it until it is at, or near parallel, to the floor without any rotation in the hip. Your goal is to keep both hips parallel to the floor. The use of a light bar placed across the hips, parallel to the waistline of your pants, provides visual feedback to hip rotation and what corrections are needed. Shoulder flexion: Slowly flex your right arm (raise and straighten the arm) attempting to raise it until it is at, or near parallel, to the floor without any tilting at the shoulders. Your goal is to keep the both shoulders parallel to the floor. The use of a light bar placed across the shoulders provides visual feedback to shoulder rotation and what corrections are needed. Your head should remain aligned with the spine throughout the movement. The degree of hip extension and shoulder flexion is determined by the ability to control against movement in the low back. As the leg is raised, individuals may witness an increase in lumbar lordosis (low back sagging). Only raise the limbs to heights where the low back position can be maintained through the combined actions of the core and abdominal muscles. Downward Phase: Gently lower yourself back to your starting position and repeat with the opposite limbs. The bird-dog is an excellent exercise to train the body how to stabilize the lumbar spine (low back) during upper and lower extremity movement. Never exceed your body's capacity to control movement in the low back.",,,,,,,,,,
31,Wrist Supination and Pronation,"Bench, Dumbbells",Biceps,"Starting Position: Holding two dumbbells, kneel and rest your elbows on a bench with approximately a 90 degree bend at the elbows and the dumbbells hanging freely off the edge of the pad. Position your forearms into neutral with the dumbbells vertical to the floor (rotate forearms to face palms inward) keeping your wrists in a neutral position (not in flexion or extension). Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly pronate your forearms (rotate the dumbbells towards the floor) while maintaining a neutral wrist (not in flexion nor extension). Avoid releasing your grip, extending your arms, leaning forward / backward or any rapid, jerking movements. Hold this end position briefly. Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly supinate your forearms (rotate the dumbbells towards the ceiling) while maintaining a neutral wrist (not in flexion nor extension). Avoid releasing your grip, extending your arms, leaning forward / backward or any rapid, jerking movements. Hold this end position briefly and repeat the entire sequence. Exercise technique is important to avoid potential injury, control the movement of your dumbbells by slowing down the movement speed at the end ranges of motion in each direction. For additional strength gains, think about squeezing the handle of the dumbbell as hard as possible during both phases of the movement.",,,,,,,,,,
369,Rotational Uppercut,Dumbbells,Biceps,"Stand with?the feet hip-width apart, hold one dumbbell in each hand with the palms?facing up,?and the elbows close to the rib cage. Sink back into the hips and press?the left foot into the ground to?turn to?the right, keep?the left elbow bent and perform an uppercut with?the left arm, bringing?the left elbow to shoulder-height. Slowly lower?the left arm and?turn back to the center. Push the right foot into the ground to turn the left hip while swinging?the right arm up in an uppercut.",,,,,,,,,,
190,Chin-ups,Pull up bar,Biceps,"Starting Position: Stand under the chin-up bar and reach your arms overhead with your palms facing you.? Reach, jump or lift your body off the floor to grasp the handles firmly with a full grip position (thumbs wrapped around the handles).? Gently cross one leg over the other to stabilize your lower extremity and then stiffen (""brace"") your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine.? Align your head vertically with your trunk under your hands and assume a neutral wrist position (i.e., wrist aligned in a straight line with your forearms).? Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) and attempt to hold this position throughout the exercise. Slowly exhale and slowly pull your body upwards by flexing (bending) your elbows and pulling your arms down to your sides  Attempt to pull in a motion that drives your elbows directly down towards the floor, keeping your elbows in front of your body.  Attempt to keep your body aligned vertically to the floor and avoid swinging your body during your upward pull. Continue pulling upward until your chin is level with the bar or your hands.  Pause momentarily then slowly return to your starting position by allowing your arms to extend back overhead until your arms are fully extended.  Continue to maintain your shoulder and wrist position, and the vertical alignment of your trunk.  Repeat the movement. Exercise Variation: The intensity of this exercise can be increased with resistance that can be added by wearing a weight belt to which weights are connected. This exercise targets the back and biceps muscles effectively, but should be performed without compromise to the shoulder. Follow the instructions provided to reduce the stress placed upon your shoulder",,,,,,,,,,
70,Bicep Curl,Barbell,Biceps,"Hold the barbell with both hands facing up so the wrists, elbows, and shoulders are in a straight line about shoulder-width apart. Lift the barbell toward the shoulders while bending?the elbows and keeping them next to?the middle of the body. Slowly lower the weight to return to the starting position. Keep chest still, using just the arms for the movement.",,,,,,,,,,
12,Bent-over Row,Barbell,Biceps,"Grip a barbell with palms?down so that the wrists, elbows, and shoulders are in a straight line. Lift the bar from the rack, bend forward at?the hips, and keep?the back straight?with a slight bend in?the?knees. Lower the bar towards the floor until the elbows are completely straight, and keep the?back flat as?the bar is pulled?towards the belly button. Then slowly lower the bar to the starting position and repeat.?",,,,,,,,,,
292,Tricep Extension,Weight Machines/Selectorized,Triceps,"Adjust the seat to a comfortable height and the?weight to the appropriate level before beginning. Sitting with a tall back, rest the upper arms on the pad and grasp the handles. Keeping the elbows?in a straight line with the shoulders, press the hands downward. Slowly return to the starting position.",,,,,,,,,,
71,Standing Shoulder Press,Barbell,Triceps,"Place a barbell in a rack at?about shoulder-height. Grip the bar with?the hands about shoulder-width apart and the palm facing the ceiling. Dip under the bar to bring it off the rack letting it rest across the?top of the shoulders so that the?palms are facing the ceiling and the elbows are pointed straight ahead. Step back, keeping the back straight and tall and press the barbell directly overhead. Slowly return the weight to the shoulders and repeat for the desired number of reps.",,,,,,,,,,
333,Tricep Pressdown,Resistance Bands/Cables,Triceps,"Stand with?the feet hip-width apart, the hips straight, the back tall, and the knees slightly bent. Place the cable pulley at the highest position, use a straight?bar attachment, and grip the bar firmly in both hands. Pull the elbows in close?to the sides and slowly push the?hands down towards the floor.?Straighten the?arms completely before bending the elbows to return to the starting position.",,,,,,,,,,
55,Tricep Kickback,Dumbbells,Triceps,"Starting Position: Hold a dumbbell in your left hand and assume a split-stance position placing your right leg forward, but keeping your weight evenly distributed through the heels of both feet. Stiffen your torso by contracting your abdominal and core muscles (""bracing""). Place your right hand on your right thigh or knee and slowly lean forward, transferring most of your upper extremity body weight into that right side. Depress and retract your left scapula (pull your shoulder down and back) and maintain this position throughout the exercise. Your head should be aligned with your spine. Position the your left upper arm parallel to, and close to, your torso. Bend your elbow to 90 degrees or at least to a point where your forearm hangs vertical to the floor. Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly extend (straighten) your elbow by contracting your triceps muscles until your elbow is fully extended. Your upper arm should remain stationary next to your torso and not raised during the movement. Avoid any arching (sagging) in your low back or any rotation in your torso. Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly return your arm to your starting position, without changing your torso position. Maintain your upper arm parallel and close to your torso. Proper form in performing this exercise is important to target triceps activity and for safety reasons to prevent additional loading on your spine.",,,,,,,,,,
3,Triceps Pressdown,Resistance Bands/Cables,Triceps,"Stand with?the feet hip-width apart, the hips straight,?the back straight and tall, and the?knees slightly bent. Place the cable pulley at the highest position, use a rope attachment, and grip the ends firmly in?both hands. Pull the?elbows close to the sides, and slowly push the?hands down towards the floor, straightening the arms all the way then bending the elbows to return to the starting position.",,,,,,,,,,
34,Incline Reverse Fly,"Bench, Dumbbells",Back,"Starting Position: Holding two dumbbells, sit on a bench facing the backrest angled at 45 to 60 degrees. Hold your torso against the backrest and keep your feet firmly placed on the floor. Allow your arms to hang towards the floor with your elbows slightly flexed and palms facing each other. Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles (¡°bracing¡±) to stabilize your spine. Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly raise the dumbbells up and out to the sides, raising the upper arms, elbows and dumbbells in unison until the arms are near level with the shoulders. Squeeze your scapulae (shoulder blades) together as you reach the end position. In the raised position, the dumbbells should be aligned with, or slightly in front of your ears. Avoid arching your back during the upward phase by keeping your torso firmly pressed into the backrest. Downward Phase: Gently inhale and lower the dumbbells in unison back to your starting position. Technique is very important in this lift. If the dumbbells are raised to an end position behind the head rather than in line with the ears, the emphasis shifts off the shoulders and onto the latissimus dorsi (back).",,,,,,,,,,
35,Kneeling Lat Pulldown,Resistance Bands/Cables,Back,Kneel and PULL!,,,,,,,,,,
158,Seated Lat Pulldown,Weight Machines/Selectorized,Back,"STARTING POSITION: Sit in the machine, anchoring your lower extremity by adjusting the thigh pad to fit firmly against the top of your thighs.? Stiffen (¡°brace¡±) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, and attempt to avoid any arching of your low back throughout the exercise.? Reach up to grasp the bar, firmly gripping the bar with both hands. While your arms are extended overhead, depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) and attempt to hold this position throughout the exercise.? Lean back slightly (no more than a 30 degree angle), using your legs to support your body (low back).? Maintain your head aligned with your spine. Slowly exhale and initiate the downward pull by first depressing (lower) your scapulae, then pulling the bar downward towards the top or mid-section of your chest. Attempt to pull in a motion that drives your elbows directly down towards the floor, bringing your elbows towards the sides of your torso. Avoid any additional backwards lean during the pull movement. Continue pulling until the bar nears or touches your chest, or more importantly, you observe your elbows no longer moving downward, but now beginning to move backwards.  Avoid any further pulling as this places additiomnal stresses into the shoulder joint. Pause momentarily, then slowly return to your starting position by allowing the bar to move upwards until your elbows are fully extended, then allow your scapule to rise slightly. Repeat the movement. Exercise Variation: Perform the exercise in a standing position with your feet in a staggered-stace (walking position).  Maintain a slight bend in your knees and shift your weight back onto your rear leg to create the backward lean. Avoid flexing (bending) forward at the hips during the pulling movement. This exercise targets the major back muscles effectively, but should be performed without compromise to the shoulder or low back. Follow the instructions provided to reduce the stress placed upon these two areas. ",,,,,,,,,,
169,Seated High Back Rows,Weight Machines/Selectorized,Back,"Starting Position: Adjust the seat height to a level that positions the machine handles approximately level with your shoulders. Position your feet firmly on the floor or foot pads to stabilize your body.? Sit upright and extend your arms to grasp the handles without rounding your shoulders forward. Adjust the position the chest pad to contact your chest lightly.? Stiffen (¡°brace¡±) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, but do not press your low back into the back rest. Maintain the natural arch in your low back and avoid arching your back throughout the exercise.? Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down), maintain a neutral wrist position (i.e., wrist in line with your forearms) and attempt to hold these positions throughout the exercise. From this start position with your torso vertical, scapulae (shoulder blades) flat against your ribcage and arms extended, gently exhale and perform a pulling movement. Flex (bend) your elbows and pull them towards your chest, but try to flair your elbows out from your sides, keeping them as level with your shoulders as possible. Continue to maintain a neutral wrist position, and contact with your chest against the chest pad.  Avoid leaning back and arching your low back and attempt to minimize any movement of your head during the movement. Continue pulling until your elbows reach level with, or pass just behind your shoulders. Pause momentarily then slowly return to your starting position, allowing the weight to pull your arms to move forward and elbows to extend (straighten) in a slow, controlled manner; the weight should straighten your arms but use your back muscles to resist the pull as the handles move away from your body, stopping when your arms are fully extended.  Maintain an upright trunk position with your spine straight and your chest lifted upwards toward the ceiling.  Do not let your spine bend forward and your back to round during this exercise.  Repeat the movement for a specific number of repetitions. Exercise Variation: To increase the exercise intensity and involve additional exercises, perform the following variations: (a) Perform unilateral (one arm at a time) pulls (b) Move the chest pad away from your body, which will now require a greater effort to stabilize your trunk as you perform the pulling movement. Allowing your shoulders to round forward as your arms extend will allow you to pull with more force. However, learn how to perform a pulling motion without scapulae (shoulder blade) movement first before introducing shoulder movement.  Additionally, reduce unnecessary stresses into your low back by avoiding any backwards lean during the pull movements.",,,,,,,,,,
168,Seated Row,Weight Machines/Selectorized,Back,"Starting Position: Adjust the seat height to a level that positions the machine handles approximately level, or near level, with your shoulders. Position your feet firmly on the floor or foot pads to stabilize your body.? Sit upright and extend your arms to grasp the handles without rounding your shoulders forward. Adjust the position the chest pad to contact your chest lightly.? Stiffen (¡°brace¡±) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, but do not press your low back into the back rest. Maintain the natural arch in your low back and avoid arching your back throughout the exercise.? Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down), maintain a neutral wrist position (i.e., wrist in line with your forearms) and attempt to hold these positions throughout the exercise. From this start position with your tors0 vertical, scapulae (shoulder blades) flat against your ribcage and arms extended, gently exhale and perform a pulling movement. Flex (bend) your elbows and pull them towards your chest keeping your elbows close to the sides of your body.  Continue to maintain a neutral wrist position, and contact with your chest against the chest pad.  Avoid leaning back and arching your low back and attempt to minimize any movement of your head during the movement. Continue pulling until your elbows pass the sides of your body. Pause momentarily then slowly return to your starting position, allowing your arms to move forward and elbows to extend (straighten) in a slow, controlled manner, moving the handles away from your body, stopping when your arms are fully extended. Maintain your upright trunk position and avoid forward rounding of your scapulae (shoulder blades). Repeat the movement. Exercise Variation: To increase the exercise intensity and involve additional exercises, perform the following variations: (a) Perform unilateral (one arm at a time) pulls (b) Move the chest pad away from your body, which will now require a greater effort to stabilize your trunk as you perform the pulling movement. Allowing your shoulders to round forward as your arms extend will allow you to pull with more force.

366,Bulgarian Split Squat,"Bench, Dumbbells",Butt/Hips,"Start with the feet hip-width apart, with?the?right foot forward and the left foot placed back behind?the body on a bench or box that is about knee-height. Hold a dumbbell in both hands?in a vertical position in front of?the chest and keep the elbows?close to the?rib cage during the exercise. Keep the back straight while lowering the left knee towards the floor.?Before?the left knee hits the floor, press?the right foot into the ground, pull back on?the right knee, and push the top of?the left foot into the box to return to standing.",,,,,,,,,,
367,Elevated Glute Bridge,"Bench, Dumbbells",Butt/Hips,"Lie on a flat bench so that the body is perpendicular to the bench with?the upper back and shoulders lying across the pad. Press?the feet into the ground about hip-width apart, hold one dumbbell in each hand and rest them on top of?the hips to add external resistance. Slowly lower?the tailbone towards the floor while holding the weights on?the hips, and to return to the top press both feet into the floor and squeeze?the glute muscles.",,,,,,,,,,
22,Front Squat,Dumbbells,Butt/Hips,"Starting Position: Stand with your feet slightly wider than hip-width, facing outward or turned slightly outwards while holding a dumbbell in each hand by your sides, with palms facing inwards. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back). Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles (¡°bracing¡±) to stabilize your spine. Curl the dumbbells to a starting position where they rest on the front edge of your shoulders or just in front of your shoulders. Hold your chest up and out, tilt your head slightly up, and shift your weight over your heels. Downward Phase: Start the downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. As you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Attempt to keep your back flat. Continue to lower yourself until your thighs are parallel or almost parallel with the floor, or until your heels begin to lift off the floor, or until your torso begins to round or flex forward. Monitor your feet, ankles and knees, ensuring that the feet don't move, the ankles do not collapse in or out and the knees remain aligned over the second toe. Lowered Position: From the front, the knees should continue to remain aligned over the second toe and body weight should be evenly distributed over both feet. From the side, the position of the tibia (shinbone) and torso should be parallel with each other and the low back should appear flat or showing the beginning of some rounding. Upward Phase: While maintaining your back, chest and head-up position, exhale and extend the hips and knees by pushing your feet into the floor through your heels. The hips and torso need to rise together while keeping the heels flat on the floor and knees aligned over the second toe. Continue extending until you reach your starting position.  Technique is very important in this lift. The tendency is to hold the tibia (shinbone) too vertical which forces you to lean your torso too far forward. Using a mirror for feedback, shift your tibia forward while keeping your heels on the floor, then bring your torso upright back (moving it more upright), but do so from the hips and not through the low back. Squeeze your abdominals to help prevent excess arching in the back with this correction.",,,,,,,,,,
293,Glute Press,Weight Machines/Selectorized,Butt/Hips,"Adjust the pad to the?proper height. Grasp the handles with elbows in a straight line with the hands and under the shoulders. Set the weight to the appropriate level before beginning. With the knees on the lower pad, place one foot on the rear platform. Press the foot into the platform and straighten the leg. Slowly return to the starting positing. Repeat for the desired number of reps before switching feet.",,,,,,,,,,
362,Goblet Squat,Dumbbells,Butt/Hips,"Stand with?the feet?about shoulder-width apart, and hold a dumbbell in a vertical position directly in front of?the chest. Keep the elbows close to the rib cage and the back straight while?lowering into a squat.?Continue lowering until?the hips are below the knees, then push both feet into the floor and?to return back to the original standing position.",,,,,,,,,,
396,Bottom-up Press,Kettlebells,Chest,Stand with?the feet hip-width apart so that?the right foot is slightly in front of?the left and hold a kettlebell in?the right hand in a ¡®bottom-up¡¯ position by holding the top of the handle so that the bottom of the kettlebell is facing up. Keep a strong grip to maintain balance of the kettlebell. Push?the?right foot into the ground to shift?the weight of the body?forward while pressing the right arm straight overhead. Pull the right elbow back down to the rib cage to lower the weight.,,,,,,,,,,
5,Chest Press,"Barbell, Bench",Chest,"Lie face up on?a flat bench, and grip?a barbell?with the hands?slightly wider than shoulder-width. Press the feet into the ground and the hips into the bench while lifting the bar off the rack. Slowly lower the bar to the chest by allowing the elbows to bend out to the side. Stop when the elbows are just below the bench, and press feet into the floor to?press the weight straight?up to return to the starting position.",,,,,,,,,,
19,Chest Press,"Bench, Dumbbells",Chest,"Starting Position: Grasp two dumbbells and lie supine (on your back) on a flat bench with your feet firmly placed on the floor or upon a raised platform to allow you to maintain a flat or neutral (flat) spine. If working with a spotter, signal the spotter for assistance in handing you your the dumbbells. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) to make firm contact with the bench. Your head, shoulders, butt and feet should make contact with the bench and floor/riser throughout the exercise. Signal your spotter for assistance in moving to your starting position. Grasp each dumbbell with a closed, pronated grip (palms facing forward, thumbs wrapped around the handle), press the dumbbells to a position level with or just below your eyes with the elbows fully extended. Maintain a neutral wrist position (avoid flexion/extension at the wrist joint). Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells in unison and in a controlled movement towards your mid-chest, but moving slightly wider towards the armpits. Gently touch the dumbbells to your chest without bouncing, maintaining your neutral wrist position. Keep the elbows close to your sides (emphasizes more triceps) or flared out from the body (emphasizes more pectorals). Maintain all points of contact with the bench and floor/riser and avoid any arching in the low back. Upward Phase: Exhale and gently press upwards to full elbow extension with the dumbbells positioned at or just below the level of your eyes. Maintain your points of contact with the bench and floor/riser, avoid arching your back during the lift and maintain neutral wrist position throughout the movement. At the end of the set, signal your spotter to assist you in taking the dumbbells and maintain a firm grip until the dumbbells are taken from your hands. Safety is very important in this exercise. A spotter should adopt a split-stance position or half-kneeling position with the hands positioned as close to the most distal (wrist) joint. Keep the hands near, but not touching the wrists unless needed.",,,,,,,,,,
311,Close-grip Bench Press,Barbell,Chest,"Lie face up on a barbell bench, then?reach up and grip the bar with the hands directly in line with?the shoulders and the elbows pointed towards?the feet. Unrack the bar and bring it towards the chest by bending the elbows and keeping them close to the ribs. Push?the feet into the floor, and press the?hips into the bench as the bar is pushed away from?the chest to return to the starting position.",,,,,,,,,,
25,Incline Chest Press,"Bench, Dumbbells",Chest,"Starting Position: Grasp two dumbbells and lie supine (on your back) on an incline bench angled between 45 and 60 degrees with your feet placed firmly on the floor or on a raised platform to allow you to maintain a neutral spine (flat to normal curvature). Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) to make firm contact with the bench. Your head, shoulders, butt and feet should make contact with the bench and floor/riser throughout the exercise. If using a spotter, signal for assistance in moving to your starting position. Grasp each dumbbell with a closed, pronated grip (palms facing forward, thumbs wrapped around the handle) and press the dumbbells in unison to a level over your eyes or slightly higher, with your elbows fully extended. Maintain a neutral wrist position (avoid flexion / extension at the wrist joint). Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells in unison and in a controlled movement towards your upper chest, but moving slightly wider towards the armpits. Gently touch the dumbbells to your chest without bouncing, maintaining your neutral wrist position. Keep the elbows under your wrists, and either close to your sides (emphasizes more triceps) or flared out from the body (emphasizes more pectorals). Maintain all points of contact with the bench and floor/riser and avoid any arching in the low back. Upward Phase: Exhale and gently press upwards to full elbow extension with the dumbbells positioned at your starting position. Maintain your points of contact with the bench and floor/riser, avoid arching your back during the lift and maintain your neutral wrist position throughout the movement. At the end of the set, signal your spotter to assist you in taking the dumbbells and maintain a firm grip until the dumbbells are taken from your hands. Safety is very important in this exercise. A spotter should adopt a split-stance position with the hands positioned as close to the most distal (wrist) joint. Keep the hands near, but not touching the wrists unless needed.",,,,,,,,,,
8,Forward Lunge,Barbell,Leg,"Place a barbell in a rack at approximately shoulder-height. Dip under the bar so that it rests behind the neck across the top of the back and shoulder blades, and grip the bar with the hands a little wider than shoulder-width apart. Lift the chest and squeeze the shoulder blades together to keep the back straight through the entire movement. Stand up to bring the bar off the rack and take 2 steps backwards. Place both feet so that they are about hip-width apart, and step forward with the right leg. Lower the left knee almost to the floor without touching the ground. From the bottom of the movement push the right foot into the floor and pull back with the left leg to stand up. Alternate the legs for the desired number of repetitions.",,,,,,,,,,
319,Reverse Lunge,Barbell,Leg,"Place a barbell in a rack at?about shoulder-height. Dip under the bar so that it rests behind the neck across the top of?the back and the shoulder blades, and grip the bar with hands a little wider than shoulder-width apart. Stand up to bring the bar off the rack, and?take one step backwards. With the feet about hip-width apart, slowly step backwards with the left leg. After?the left foot hits the ground push back into the right hip to slowly lower the?left knee towards the floor while keeping the?chest raised towards the ceiling. Press the right foot into the ground and think about pulling the?right knee backwards while swinging the?left leg forward to return to standing.",,,,,,,,,,
317,Romanian Deadlift,Barbell,Leg,"Holding a barbell with both hands so that it rests on the front of?the thighs, keep a slight bend in both knees and a straight back.?Push?the hips back while lowering the weight towards the floor until feeling some tension along the back of the legs. To return to standing, push the heels into the floor and pull the knees backwards, keeping the bar very close to the body while standing.",,,,,,,,,,
154,Seated Leg Press,Weight Machines/Selectorized,Leg,"STARTING POSITION: Sit in the machine, positioning your back and sacrum (tailbone) flat against the machine's backrest. Place your feet on the resistance plate, toes pointing forward and adjust your seat and foot position so that the bend in your knees is at approximately 90 degrees with your heels flat. Lightly grasp any available handles to stabilize your upper extremity.  Contract (¡°brace¡±) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, be careful to avoid movement in your low back throughout the exercise. Slowly exhale while pushing the resistance plate away from your body by contracting your glutes, quadiceps and hamstrings. Keep your heels flat against the resistance plate and avoid any movement in the upper extremity. Continue extending your hips and knees until the knees reach a relaxed, extended position, with the heels still pressed firmly into the plate.  Do not hyperextend (lock-out) your knees and avoid lifting your butt off the seat pad or rounding out your low back.
 Pause momentarily, then slowly return to your starting position by flexing (bending) the hips and knees, and allowing the resistance plate to move towards you in a slow, controlled manner.  Do not allow your upper thighs to compress your ribcage. Repeat the movement. Exercise Variation: Single-leg press. Repeat the same exercise, but use each leg independently. Improper technique can lead to injury. Control the extension phase by keeping your heels in contact with the plate and avoid locking out your knees. During the return phase, control the movement and avoid compressing your upper thighs against your ribcage.",,,,,,,,,,
11,Back Squat,Barbell,Leg,"Place a barbell in a rack just below shoulder-height. Dip under the bar to put it behind the neck across the top of?the back, and?grip the bar with the hands wider than shoulder-width apart. Lift the chest up and squeeze the shoulder blades together to keep the straight back throughout the entire movement. Stand up to bring the bar off the rack and step backwards, then place?the feet so that they are a little wider than shoulder-width apart. Sit back into hips and keep the back straight and the chest up,?squatting down so the hips are below the knees. From the bottom of the squat, press feet into the ground and push hips forward to return to the top of the standing position.",,,,,,,,,,
295,Lateral Shoulder Raise,Weight Machines/Selectorized,Shoulder,"Adjust the weight to the appropriate level before beginning. Sit facing the machine with the feet out in front and arms slightly bent and the pads resting just above the elbows. Keeping the arms bent at 90 degrees,?lift the pads upward by pressing out through the elbows and?raising the upper arms. Slowly return to the starting position.",,,,,,,,,,
368,Rotaional Overhead Press,Dumbbells,Shoulder,"Stand with?the feet hip-width apart, hold one dumbbell in each hand with the palms facing each other and the weights in front of the shoulders. Keep the back straight and turn to the right, and when facing?the 3 o¡¯clock position press?the right hand straight into the air. To lower the weight, pull?the elbow back down and keep the back straight while turning?to?the left. When facing the 9 o¡¯clock position on the left side,?press?the left hand straight into the air.",,,,,,,,,,
187,Seated Machine Close-Grip Shoulder Press,Weight Machines/Selectorized,Shoulder,"Starting Position: Sit with your back firmly supported against the backrest. Adjust the seat height so that the handles are level with your shoulders or just higher than your shoulders. Grasp the handles closest to your body firmly with a full grip (thumbs clasped around the handles) and maintain a neutral position with your wrists (i.e., wrists in line with your forearms).  Position your elbows pointing towards the front of your body (i.e., not in the traditional 3 and 9 o'clock positions where the elbows are aligned with the midline of your trunk).  This position shifts more of the load into the triceps and away from the shoulders.  Position your feet firmly on the floor or on the foot rests to stabilize your body.  Stiffen (¡°brace¡±) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, but do not press your low back into the backrest.  Maintain the natural arch in your low back and avoid arching your back throughout the exercise.  Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) and attempt to hold this position throughout the exercise. Gently exhale and slowly perform an upward pressing movement, extending your elbows overhead while maintaining a neutral wrist position, head aligned with your spine and avoiding arching your low back. Continue pressing until your elbows are fully extended, but not locked.  Pause momentarily then gently contract your lats (back muscles) to pull the handles back down towards your starting position, allowing your elbows to flex (bend) in a slow, controlled manner while returning to their starting forward-facing position. Repeat the movement. Exercise Variation: To increase the exercise intensity, perform the following variations: (a) Perform unilateral (one arm at a time) presses (b) Sit upright off the backrest, which will require a greater effort from your core to stabilize your trunk as you perform the press movement. This position is more comfortable and less stressful on the shoulders and more appropriate for individuals who experience some discomfort when performing traditional shoulder presses as it shifts more load into the triceps. In the overhead position, the shoulder is relatively unstable. To protect your shoulder it is important to engage your lats (back muscles) to initiate the downward movement as oppsed to simply yielding to gravity. This will help stabilize your shoulder.",,,,,,,,,,
371,Diagonal Raise,Dumbbells,Shoulder,"Stand with?the feet hip-width apart, hold one dumbbell in the?left hand with the left arm down straight and the left palm resting in front of?the?right thigh. Press?the feet into the ground, keep the hips straight and the back tall.?Raise the left arm across?the body and out to?the left side so that the weight is brought up to shoulder-height and the arm is kept straight.",,,,,,,,,,
