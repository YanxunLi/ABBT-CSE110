371,Diagonal Raise,Dumbbells,Shoulder,"Stand with the feet hip-width apart, hold one dumbbell in the left hand with the left arm down straight and the left palm resting in front of the right thigh.

117,BOSU Squat Jumps,BOSU Trainer,Abs,"Place a BOSU on the floor 3-6"" in front of your feet on a non-slip surface. Stand with your feet hip-width apart or closer, arms by your sides, depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal / core muscles) to stiffen your spine. Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then slowly moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. Continue to lower yourself until you feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Try to maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips, keep your head facing the BOSU directly and position to your arms where comfortable or where they offer the greatest degree of balance support. Pause briefly at the bottom of your downward phase, explode upwards through your lower extremity onto the top of the BOSU, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As you jump into the air, keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor, but bring them together to land on the top of the BOSU. The most important components of the landing phase on a BOSU are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees. Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels to create a level foot, parallel with the floor. Always push your hips backwards and drop your hips to absorb the jumping forces. Avoid locking out your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries. Land with your trunk inclined slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine. "
119,BOSU Lateral Jumps,BOSU Trainer,Abs,"Place a BOSU on the floor 3-6"" to your left on a non-slip surface.

Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then slowly moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. Continue to lower yourself until your feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips, keep your head facing directly forward and position to your arms where they offer the greatest degree of balance support. Pause briefly at the bottom of your downward phase, explode sideways (left) and upwards through your lower extremity onto the top of the BOSU, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As your jump into the air, try to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor, but bring them together to land on the top of the BOSU. The most important components of the landing phase on a BOSU are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees.

Pause briefly at the bottom of your landing phase, explode sideways (left) and upwards again through your lower extremity off the top of the BOSU towards the floor, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As you jump into the air, try to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor, moving them back to a hip-width stance (position) or slightly closer. "
135,Bodyweight Squat,None,Abs,"Begin standing with your feet slightly wider than hip-width, with the toes turned slightly outwards with your hands by your sides so the palms facing inwards. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull the shoulders down and back). Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine. Hold your chest up and out, tilt your head slightly up, shift your weight back into your heels while pushing your hips towards the wall behind you. Start the downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your hips and knees simultaneously. As you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Maintain tension in the core muscles (continue bracing) and attempt to keep your back flat. Continue to lower yourself until your thighs are parallel or almost parallel with the floor, until your heels begin to lift off the floor, or until your torso begins to round or flex forward. Monitor your feet, ankles and knees, ensuring that the feet don't move, the ankles do not collapse in or out and the knees remain aligned over the second toe. The knees should continue to remain aligned over the second toe and body weight should be evenly distributed between the balls and heels of the feet. From the side, the position of the tibia (shinbone) and torso should be parallel with each other and the low back should appear flat or showing the beginning of some rounding. While maintaining your back, chest and head-up position, exhale and extend the hips and knees by pushing your feet into the floor through your heels. The hips and torso need to rise together while keeping the heels flat on the floor and knees aligned over the second toe. Continue extending until you reach your starting position. "
14,Bird-dog,None,Abs,"Kneel on an exercise mat or floor, positioning your knees and feet hip-width apart, with your feet dorsi-flexed (toes pointing towards your body). Slowly lean forward to place your hands on the mat, positioning them directly under your shoulders at shoulder-width with your fingers facing forward. Reposition your hands and knees as necessary so that your knees are directly under your hips and hands are directly under your shoulders. Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles to position your spine in a neutral position, avoid any excessive sagging or arching. This exercise involves simultaneous movement of your leg and contralateral (opposite) arm. This exercise is best performed facing a mirror. Slowly extend your left hip (raise and straighten the knee) attempting to extend it until it is at, or near parallel, to the floor without any rotation in the hip. Your goal is to keep both hips parallel to the floor. The use of a light bar placed across the hips, parallel to the waistline of your pants, provides visual feedback to hip rotation and what corrections are needed. Slowly flex your right arm (raise and straighten the arm) attempting to raise it until it is at, or near parallel, to the floor without any tilting at the shoulders. Your goal is to keep the both shoulders parallel to the floor. The use of a light bar placed across the shoulders provides visual feedback to shoulder rotation and what corrections are needed. Your head should remain aligned with the spine throughout the movement. The degree of hip extension and shoulder flexion is determined by the ability to control against movement in the low back. As the leg is raised, individuals may witness an increase in lumbar lordosis (low back sagging). Only raise the limbs to heights where the low back position can be maintained through the combined actions of the core and abdominal muscles. Gently lower yourself back to your starting position and repeat with the opposite limbs."

Inhale and slowly pronate your forearms (rotate the dumbbells towards the floor) while maintaining a neutral wrist (not in flexion nor extension). Avoid releasing your grip, extending your arms, leaning forward / backward or any rapid, jerking movements. Hold this end position briefly. Exhale and slowly supinate your forearms (rotate the dumbbells towards the ceiling) while maintaining a neutral wrist (not in flexion nor extension). Avoid releasing your grip, extending your arms, leaning forward / backward or any rapid, jerking movements. Hold this end position briefly and repeat the entire sequence. "
